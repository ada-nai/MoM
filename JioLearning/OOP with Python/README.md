## Python Object-Oriented-Programming Assignment


> Hello there! I hope you enjoyed the session on  Python Object Oriented Programming and have learnt something you can implement in your own way. 
Whether or not you are acquainted with OOP, this assignment should help you refresh the concepts you have learnt in the session.

- There are two problems in the assignment
    1. Building Rational-ly
    2. Inheritance with Students
    
###  Building Rational-ly
>  In this assignment, we will work on the Rational class we used in the session. You might have to rework on the base structure and build on it. 

- There are two files for this assignment:  
    i. RationalNumbers.py (You have to complete the code in this file)  
    ii. TestCases.py (You **do not** have to work on this file. This file contains a few test-cases to check if your code works well)
- Use the `RationalNumbers.py` file to complete the code

- You need to fill the code where `ToDo` is mentioned in the comments.

- **NOTE**: Some structure for code is provided, but it might not be the desired structure, you need to modify it to make the code work accordingly.

#### Executing your code
- You should have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system
- Once you have written all the code blocks, open your terminal window 
- In your terminal window, browse to your code directory (both files as mentioned above should be in the same directory)
- Execute: `python test_cases.py`
- If all the testcases have been executed successfully, you should not get any error. `Good work!!!`

###  Inheritance with Students
- To try out this problem, you will be redirected to HackerRank, a coding platform for problems
- Try to implement your learning of Inheritance by solving this [problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-inheritance/problem) from HackerRank 
- The problem and instructions to solve it are mentioned on the page itself


Great job on solving both problems!
